# Getting Started With Git and GitHub
Learning Git and GitHub. The following commands below are to be run in the Terminal. I am using  Linux for learn git. For a good overview on how to use the Terminal see this tutorial from [Apna College](https://youtu.be/Ez8F0nW6S-w?si=mJsZaNA1MjiHrHY1). There is also a [GitHub Desktop Application](https://desktop.github.com/) for GitHub if you'd prefer to not use the Terminal.App.
